`user$ brew search mongodb`
And receive this answer:

`==> Searching local taps...
 mongodb                 mongodb@3.0             mongodb@3.2             
 mongodb@3.4             percona-server-mongodb`
Now:

`$ brew install mongodb@3.0`
OK, next I have a note to myself about creating these next directories in my root directory, but I did it in my current User (which has administrative access on the OS). These commands need to be precise and in this order:

`$ sudo mkdir -p /data/db`
(enter your OSX User password when prompted)

`$ sudo chown -R $USER /data/db`

`$ sudo chmod go+w /data/db`
This next one came from another S.O. answer: How to install earlier version of mongodb with homebrew?

`$ brew link --force mongodb@3.0`
This next command is provided after successful completion of the --force command:

`$ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/mongodb@3.0/bin:$PATH"' >> 
 ~/.bash_profile`
Now, you can run your Mongo as a Daemon with:

`$ mongod`
